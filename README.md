 ## Introduction: 
The Project is Standard Dbms Project, where we are providing users remote access to all their data. In addition to this, we have given three roles to our users - 
Admin - superUser (can add student and staff).
Staff(teacher) - can add student, only if he or she is the class teacher of the particular class. A teacher can make changes to marks only if he is teaching that course.
Student - Only can see their profile and have access to all common information on site.
